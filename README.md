# twitter-d3-tool

This project was an independent project carried out by Melikte Paulos Bekele and Eelke Bakker.
The goal of the project was to create an interactive d3-based tool which can be used
to analyze comments on a specific tweet. The analysis contains both information on the type
of comments (whether they are positive/negative), as well as on the users that commented.
